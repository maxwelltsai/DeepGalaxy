# DeepGalaxy: Classifying the properties of galaxy mergers using Deep Convolutional Networks

This project aims to leverage the capability of pattern recognization in modern deep learning to classify the properties of galaxy mergers. Galaxy mergers (the dynamical process during which two galaxies collide) are among the most spectacular phenomena in the Universe. During the merger process, the two interacting galaxies are tidally distorted, producing elongated shaped galaxies with tidal arms. Many irregular galaxies are created through this mechanism, and the evolving visual feature in this dynamic process can be considered as an image classification problem in the fields of computer vision and machine learning.

In this project, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained with visualization of galaxy merger simulations. Accordingly, the dynamical properties (e.g., the timescale in which two galaxies collide) are obtained from the numerical simulations, which are then encoded as the labels (in the supervised learning process). 

The simulations are carried out using [`Bonsai`](https://github.com/treecode/Bonsai) (BÃ©dorf et al., 2012, 2019), a GPU-accelerated Barnes-Hut tree code. 

The CNN is built with state-of-the-art architectures, such as [EfficientNet (Tan & Le, 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946) and [ResNet (He et al. 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385). The `EfficientNet` implementation is based on [this repository](https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet). The implementations of other CNNs (including `ResNet50`) are based on the `tf.keras.applications` module. A full list of supported CNNs can be found at [keras applications](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications).



## Prerequisites
- Python 3 (tested on Python 3.6 and 3.7)
- TensorFlow (1.14 or above, 2.1 or above)

- Scikit-image
- OpenCV-Python
- h5py
- Horovod (optional; 0.19 or above)
- MPI (OpenMPI/MPICH, required when Horovod is installed)


Use the package manager conda to install dependencies.

```
conda install -r requirements.txt -n tf2gpu
conda activate tf2gpu
```

## Training data
We simulated galaxy mergers of different mass ratios and size ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 2:3). The snapshots of the simulations are visualized once every 5 Myr (million years) using cameras from 14 different positions, and therefore generating 14 2D images. Each simulation should complete within a timescale of about 700 Myr. These images are stored in a compressed HDF5 dataset. The available image resolution are (256, 256), (512, 512), (1024, 1024), and (2048, 2048) pixels. The dataset is balanced.

## Training

The training can be done on a single node or multiple nodes. If you are running the code on an HPC cluster, please allocate resources prior to running the code. The file `dg_train.py` is the training script to run. It supports a number of command-line arguments. To obtain a full list of arguments, type `python dg_train.py -h`. Here are some useful ones:

- `-f <dataset.hdf5>`: the file name and path of the HDF5 image dataset (required).
- `--epochs`: The number of epoches to carry out the training. 
- `--arch`: the CNN architecture to use, e.g., `EfficientNetB4`, `EfficientNetB7`, `ResNet50` (case sensitive). A list of supported architectures can be found at https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications.
- `--batch-size`: the batch size to use in the training. Usually this is constrained by the size of (GPU) memory.
- `--num-camera`: the number of camera positions to use for data augmentation. An integer from 1 to 14 is acceptable.
- `-d`: datasets to use for training. To use all datasets stored in the HDF5 file, type `s_*`. To include datasets only with size ratio of 1.5, type `s_1.5_*`, and so on.
- `--noise`: mitigating overfitting by imposing a random Gaussian noise. This argument specifies the standard derivation of the noise. 
- `-m`: Reshuffle the training/testing dataset every `-m` epochs. This option is useful in distributed training, since a compute node will only load a fraction of the full dataset. If `-m` is set to -1, every node/worker will load the full dataset; If `-m` is set to 0, the training/testing data are splitted among nodes/workers and are loaded only once during the initialization phase of the code, and a compute node will never be able to see the data on other nodes. If `-m` is set to an integer larger than 0, the training/testing data are also splitted among nodes/workers, but the data loading pipeline will be triggered every `-m` epochs, allowing a node to access data that are previous on other nodes.
- `--debug`: enables debug model when this flag is presented in the command line. This will cause the code to save model checkpoints per epoch and invoke TensorBoard callbacks.

### Training on a single node.

```
python dg_train.py -f output_bw_512.hdf5 --epochs 20 --noise 0.1 --batch-size 4 --arch EfficientNetB4
```
Please replace `output_bw_512.hdf5` with the actual file name of the HDF5 dataset. Change `epochs`, `noise`, `arch`, and other commandline arguments whenever necessary.

### Training on multiple nodes.

Multi-node training relies on [`horovod`](https://github.com/horovod/horovod), a distributed training framework built on the top of DL frameworks and collective communication protocols. To carry out a parallel training session, the following command can be used in the batch script:

```
mpirun -np 32 python dg_train.py -f output_bw_512.hdf5 --epochs 20 --noise 0.1 --batch-size 4 --arch EfficientNetB4
```
where `-np 32` should be changed according to the actual number of MPI processes. For example, if 8 nodes are allocated, and each node with 4 processors (e.g., GPU), then `np = 8 * 4 = 32`. If GPUs are used, `DeepGalaxy` will automatically bind each MPI process to a GPU.  Please replace `output_bw_512.hdf5` with the actual file name of the HDF5 dataset. Change `epochs`, `noise`, `arch`, and other commandline arguments whenever necessary.

## Large models
When high-resolution images are trained on a large DNN, the memory consumption of the DNN parameters and activation maps may (far) exceed the available GPU memory. In this case, it is still possible to map the host memory to the GPUs. This can be done by passing a value greater than 1 to the `--gpu-mem-frac` argument. For example, `--gpu-mem-frac 5` means that it allows CUDA to allocate 5 times the size of the GPU memory. So if the GPU memory is 32 GB, then the usable memory for the GPU in this case will be 160 GB.

Please note that this option usually comes with performance penalty. Alternatively, running large models on CPUs may actually be faster in certain hardware configurations.
